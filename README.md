# Habit Tracker App

Welcome to the Habit Tracker App, a Vue 3 based application designed to help track and maintain daily habits. 

## Features

### Main View

- **Day Navigation**: Easily navigate between days to check off habits. The app is optimized for the past 7 days, providing a more intuitive experience than a standard date picker.
- **Habit Completion**: Mark or unmark habits as completed for any past day, ensuring you keep track of your progress accurately. Future days are not selectable to prevent marking habits in advance.

### Habit List

- View a list of your daily habits in one place.
- Use simple toggle button to mark habits as completed for the day.

### Adding New Habits

- Add new habits through a separate page.

### User Experience

- **Responsive Design**: Fully compatible across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Error Handling**: Intuitive and friendly error messages to enhance usability.
- **Aesthetics**: Emphasis on simple design and smooth animations to make habit tracking a delight.

### Special Feature: Habit Streaks

- Encourages users not to break a habit. A streak counter displays the number of consecutive days a habit has been completed, with special highlighting for personal best streaks.
